Maker Market Application is an e-commerce platform that connects customers with local independent creators and makers, providing a unique and personalized shopping experience. Our application will allow customers to browse and purchase handmade products, and have them delivered right to their doorstep.
      
      Many local independent creators and small-batch makers are unable to reach customers and sell their unique, high-quality products, while consumers looking for or interested in buying unique, authentic items often have difficulty to find and buy these high-quality handmade products.
      
      Our application will provide an online platform that connects local independent creators and small-batch makers with customers seeking unique, high-quality, handmade products. By providing a dedicated platform for independent creators and customers to connect, Maker Market Application addresses the problem of visibility and accessibility, making it easier for both parties to find and engage with each other.
